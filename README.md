# Pose-Graph
 
The project is still being worked on.

The train.py file trains on Sequence 1 of Frieburg COLD dataset. The load_data.py file controls this data loading behaviour.

The test.py runs over 100 test sequences and saves the results in an npy file.

The model/superglue.py file contains the loss function for modified loss including RANSAC.
